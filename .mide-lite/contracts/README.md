# Contracts

Schemas for all I/O boundaries. Keep artifacts FULL (no ellipses) and include references.

Agent
- Input/Output: `.mide-lite/contracts/agent/`

Workflow
- Step Input/Output: `.mide-lite/contracts/workflow/`
- Workflow Input/Output: `.mide-lite/contracts/workflow/`

Supervisor quick reference
- Discover: `.mide-lite/workflows/index.yaml` → choose by keywords/tags (create WorkflowInput)
- Execute: produce StepInput per phase → expect StepOutput
- Aggregate: emit WorkflowOutput (preserve full artifacts)
